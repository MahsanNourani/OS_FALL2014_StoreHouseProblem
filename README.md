# OS_FALL93_StoreHouseProblem
A client-server application for a store house, which records each incoming and outgoing item, shows list of all available items, and shows quantity of special item.
Also, it is implemented using pipe and shared memory alongside socket programming with select for client-server connection. 
This code is developed for my Operating systems course in Fall 2014 when I was in Sophomore year.
